### My Art Project: The Bouncing Rectangles 
![Sarah Perrin](images/screenshot.png?raw=true "Sarah Perrin")

Every time the rectange(s) hits one end of the screen, another is added and all of the existing rectangles change color. If any key is pressed, the rectangles will speed up and a sign that says "Slow Down!" will replace them.
